<b><u>Extended Play History Download Instructions<u><b>

In order to power this tool, you'll need a log of your full Spotify play history.  When you click the link below, you will be redicted to Spotify's official website.

1. Sign in if you aren't already
2. From your profile in the top right, click **Account**
3. Scroll down to **Security and Privacy** and click **Account Privacy**
4. Scroll down to **Download Your Data**
5. Select **Extended Streaming History**
6. Submit a request for your data

Once it's ready, Spotify will send you a link to download!  They say it can take up to 30 days, but in my experience it's typically less than a week.  Once you've got the file, just flip that .zip right into the dashboard!  No need to extract, the tool takes care of it.

Cheers!<br>Hayden
